# diophantine_approx
Lean project for Diophantine Approximation

The plan is to get a set of basic result in diophantine approximation.
Long-Term goal is to obtain proof of Thue's and Roth's Theorems (and possibly their applications to solutions of Diophantine Equations). 

## First goal: Liouville Theorem
Formalize a full proof of Liouville Theorem following Zannier's book _Diophantine Analysis_

Main contributors: Amos Turchet, Francesco Veneziano
