# diophantine_approx
Lean project for Diophantine Approximation

The plan is to get a set of basic result in diophantine approximation.
Mid-Term goal is to aim for a full proof of Roth's Theorem.
Long-Term goal is to obtain proof of the fundamental finiteness theorems for integral and rational points on algebraic curves such as Siegel's Theorem and Faltings' Theorem.
